Coda delle scritture data/index

on write=> pick address from emtpyList, put it on reserved list, enqueue write operation

Dequeue => Write async in block (and clean reserved empty slot) 
	=> !commit = wait for writing => update root node address => flush => add "deleted" nodes addresses to the update empty slots (async) 

	if commit fails => reserved slots return to empty list, truncate file to initial pointer, clean freed empty slots



	Performances : 
		- Cache LRU for reading nodes
		- batches writes at commit


	Multitasking (multiple readers, one writer)
	LRU node cache
